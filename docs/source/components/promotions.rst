Promotions
==========

Promotions are images with links that are used to promote areas of the site.  They 
take two forms:

* Banners
* Pods - these are normally rectangular images that are positioned in the left- or
  right-hand sidebars

The link is optional - just the image can be used.

The number of click-throughs is recorded.
