Compatibility
~~~~~~~~~~~~~

What's new in Oscar 3.0?
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

- Support has been added to the ``catalogue.Option`` model to define the
  type of option. This is used by the ``AddToBasketForm`` to determine the appropriate form field to display for that
  option in the add-to-cart form. Currently supported types are: text, integer, float, boolean, and date.

  The ``type`` field on the ``Option`` model (previously used to denote whether the option is required)
  has been repurposed to store the type of the option, and a new ``required`` field
  has been added to denote whether the option is required. Projects that have forked the catalogue app will
  need to generate custom migrations for these model field changes.
  Projects should pay close attention to the data migration provided in
  ``catalogue/migrations/0019_option_required.py`` for this change.


Backwards incompatible changes
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

- The ``StockRecord.price_excl_tax`` field has been renamed to ``StockRecord.price``.
  Projects that have forked the ``partner`` app will need to generate their own migration
  to rename this field.

Bug fixes
~~~~~~~~~


Removal of deprecated features
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

- Several deprecated model fields have been removed in Oscar 3.0:

   - ``order.Line.est_dispatch_date``
   - ``order.Line.unit_cost_price``
   - ``order.Line.unit_retail_price``
   - ``partner.StockRecord.cost_price``
   - ``partner.StockRecord.price_retail``

  Oscar ships with migrations that remove these fields. If you want to continue using them,
  please make sure you add the fields back to your forked app before migrating. Projects
  that have forked the ``order`` and ``partner`` apps will need to generate their own
  migrations to remove these fields.


Minor changes
~~~~~~~~~~~~~

- Several models were updated to define a default ordering, to avoid issues with inconsistent ordering of
  items in the dashboard and elsewhere. Database migrations are required for these changes.
