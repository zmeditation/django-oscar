What's new in Oscar 3.0?
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

- The ``StockRecord.price_excl_tax`` field has been renamed to ``StockRecord.price``.
  Projects that have forked the ``partner`` app will need to generate their own migration
  to rename this field.

Removal of deprecated features
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

- Several deprecated model fields have been removed in Oscar 3.0:

   - ``order.Line.est_dispatch_date``
   - ``order.Line.unit_cost_price``
   - ``order.Line.unit_retail_price``
   - ``partner.StockRecord.cost_price``
   - ``partner.StockRecord.price_retail``

  Oscar ships with migrations that remove these fields. If you want to continue using them,
  please make sure you add the fields back to your forked app before migrating. Projects
  that have forked the ``order`` and ``partner`` apps will need to generate their own
  migrations to remove these fields.
