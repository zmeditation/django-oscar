Overview
========

Oscar now has a demo site customised for the US!

Lots of methods deprecated in the 0.6 release have now been removed.
Specifically, the partner "wrapper" functionality is now gone. All price and
availability logic now needs to be handled with strategies.

.. _compatibility_of_0.8:

Compatibility
=============

Oscar 0.8 is compatible with Django 1.5-1.7. 

Support for Python 2.6 has been dropped; Oscar works with Python 2.7, 3.3
and 3.4.

.. _new_in_0.8:

What's new in Oscar 0.8?
========================

Customisation just got easier!
------------------------------

* Oscar's views are now dynamically imported. This means that they can be
  overridden like most other classes in Oscar; overriding the related
  Application instance is not necessary any more.

* A new management command, ``oscar_fork_app``, has been introduced to help
  with the all-to-common pattern of forking an Oscar app to override one of
  it's classes.

* The documentation around :doc:`/topics/customisation` has been given an
  overhaul to incorporate the changes.

US demo site
------------

To help developers building sites for the US, a new example Oscar site has been
included in the repo. This customises core Oscar to treat all prices as
excluding tax and then calculate and apply taxes once the shipping address is
known.

See :ref:`us_site` for more information.

Cleanup around shipping methods
-------------------------------

* The models of the shipping app now have abstract base classes, similar to
  the rest of Oscar.

* The legacy ``ShippingMethod`` name of the interface of the shipping app has
  been removed. Inherit from ``shipping.base.Base`` for the class instead, and
  inherit from ``shipping.abstract_models.AbstractBase`` for model-based
  shipping methods.

* ``oscar.apps.shipping.Scales`` has been renamed and moved to
  ``oscar.apps.shipping.scales.Scale``, and is now overridable.

* ``WeightBand.upper_limit`` is now a ``DecimalField``, just like the other
  weight-related fields.

* The Django admin interface for the ``WeightBased`` shipping method has been
  made slightly more useful. Contributions for a dedicated dashboard app are
  most welcome!

.. _minor_changes_in_0.8:

Minor changes
-------------

* The ``OSCAR_CURRENCY_LOCALE`` setting has been removed. The locale is now
  automatically determined from the current language. This ensures prices are
  always shown in the correct format when switching languages.

* The login and registration view now redirects staff users to the dashboard
  after logging in. It also employs flash messages to welcome returning and
  newly registered users.

* The basket middleware now assigns a ``basket_hash`` attribute to the
  ``request`` instance. This provides a hook for basket caching.

* The tracking pixel now also reports the Oscar version in use. This was
  forgotten when adding tracking of the Python and Django version in 0.7.
  Total information collected now is the versions of Django, Python and Oscar.

* ``OSCAR_SLUG_FUNCTION`` now accepts both string notation and a callable.

* The default templates now allow the order status to be changed on the
  dashboard order detail page.

* The forms for the order dashboard views are now loaded dynamically so they
  can be overridden.

Bugfixes
~~~~~~~~

.. _incompatible_changes_in_0.8:

Backwards incompatible changes in 0.8
=====================================

* The ``shipping`` app saw a few renames; please see the section above.
* The ``oscar_calculate_scores`` command has been `rewritten`_ to use the ORM
  instead of raw SQL. That exposed a bug in the previous calculations,
  where purchases got weighed less than any other event. When you upgrade,
  your total scores will be change. If you rely on the old behaviour,
  just extend the ``Calculator`` class and adjust the weights.
* ``Product.score`` was just duplicating ``ProductRecord.score`` and has been
  removed. Use ``Product.stats.score`` instead.
* Oscar has child products to model tightly coupled products, and
  ``Product.recommended_products`` to model products that are loosely related
  (e.g. used for upselling). ``Product.related_products`` was a
  third option that sat somewhere in between, and which was not well supported.
  We fear it adds confusion, and in the spirit of keeping Oscare core lean,
  has been removed. If you're using it, switch to
  ``Product.recommended_products`` or just add the field back to your
  custom Product instance and ``ProductForm`` when migrating.

Basket line stockrecords
------------------------

The basket line model got a reference to the stockrecord in Oscar 0.6. The
basket middleware since then updated basket lines to have stockrecords if
one was missing. If any lines are still missing a stockrecord, we'd expect them
to be from from submitted baskets or from old, abandoned baskets.
This updating of basket lines has been removed for 0.8 as it incurs additional
database queries. Oscar 0.8 now also enforces the stockrecord by making it
the ``stockrecord`` field of basket ``Line`` model no longer nullable.

There is a migration that makes the appropriate schema change but, before that
runs, you may need to clean up your ``basket_line`` table to ensure that all
existing null values are replaced or removed.

Here's a simple script you could run before upgrading which should ensure there
are no nulls in your ``basket_line`` table:

.. code-block:: python

    from oscar.apps.basket import models
    from oscar.apps.partner.strategy import Selector

    strategy = Selector().strategy()

    lines = models.Line.objects.filter(stockrecord__isnull=True):
    for line in lines:
        info = strategy.fetch_for_product(line.product)
        if line.stockrecord:
            line.stockrecord = info.stockrecord
            line.save()
        else:
            line.delete()

* The ``reload_page_response`` method of 
  :class:`~oscar.apps.dashboard.orders.views.OrderDetailView`
  has been renamed to ``reload_page``.

    - ``0021`` - Add ``unique_together`` to ``ProductAttributeValue``,
      ``ProductRecommendation`` and ``ProductCategory``
