Oscar 1.0.1 release notes - UNDER DEVELOPMENT
=============================================

This is Oscar 1.0.1, a bug fix release.

Bug fixes
=========

* `#1553`_: ``from oscar.apps.partner.models import *`` could lead to the
  wrong models being imported.

* `#1556`_: Dashboard order table headers shifted

* `#1577`_: The billing address was not being correctly passed through to the
  `place_order` method.

* `#1592`_: ``Product.min_child_price_[excl|incl]_tax`` were broken and
  failing loudly. They are not recommended any more, but to ensure
  backwards-compatibility, they have been fixed.
