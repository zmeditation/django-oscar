Oscar 1.0.1 release notes - UNDER DEVELOPMENT
=============================================

This is Oscar 1.0.1, a bug fix release.

Bug fixes
=========

* `#1556`_: Dashboard order table headers shifted

* `#1557`_: Fixed an issue where Oscar wrongly used Django's ``is_safe_url``.
  Hence some redirects might not have worked as expected. This change
  unfortunately meant updating the notation of
  :meth:`oscar.core.utils.safe_referrer` and
  :meth:`oscar.core.utils.redirect_to_referrer` to accept the request instead
  of request.META.

* `#1577`_: The billing address was not being correctly passed through to the
  `place_order` method.

* `#1553`_: ``from oscar.apps.partner.models import *`` could lead to the
  wrong models being imported.
