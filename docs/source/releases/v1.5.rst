Backwards incompatible changes in Oscar 1.5
-------------------------------------------

- `SimpleAddToBasketForm` doesn't override the quantity field any
  more. Instead, it just hides the field declared by AddToBasketForm
  and sets the quantity to one. This means `SimpleAddToBasketForm`
  doesn't need to be overridden for most cases, but please check
  things still work as expected for you if you have customized it.
