What's new in Oscar 0.6?
========================

The payment models have been split into abstract- and concrete versions.  This
brings them inline with other Oscar apps and allows them to be customised.

Demo site
~~~~~~~~~

Oscar now ships with a demo site along side the sandbox site.  While the sandbox
is a minimal Django project that uses Oscar with all its defaults, the demo site
is a more realistic example of an Oscar project.  It has a custom skin and makes
many alterations to the default Oscar behaviour.  

It's features include:

* A range of different product types: books, downloads, clothing
* PayPal Express integration using django-oscar-paypal_
* Datacash integration using django-oscar-datacash_

.. _django-oscar-paypal: https://github.com/tangentlabs/django-oscar-paypal
.. _django-oscar-datacash: https://github.com/tangentlabs/django-oscar-datacash

Accounts 
~~~~~~~~

The views and templates of the accounts section have been reworked to be clearer
and easier to extend.

Upgrading 
=========

Templatetags:

* The ``basket_form`` templatetag has been altered to take the ``request`` as the
  first argument, not ``request.basket``.

Templates:

* The template ``customer/email/email.html`` has been renamed to
  ``customer/email/email_detail.html``.

* The template ``customer/orders/order.html`` has been renamed to
  ``customer/orders/order_detail.html``.

Payment app:

* The `balance` method on the source object is not a property not a method.
