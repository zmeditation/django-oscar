What's new in Oscar 2.0?
------------------------

Removal of deprecated features
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Minor changes
~~~~~~~~~~~~~
 - Dropped ``action=""`` and ``action="."`` attributes, following the lead of Django
   and as per the HTML5 specification.

- Replaced use of Django's procedural auth views with the corresponding
  class-based views.

- ``OrderPlacementMixin.get_message_context()`` is now passed a ``code`` argument
  specifying the communication event type code for a message being sent.

- We've dropped the dependency on Unidecode due to license incompatibilities,
  ``oscar.core.utils.default_slugifier`` now uses ``oscar.core.utils.cautious_slugify``
  to handle unicode characters in slugs when ``OSCAR_SLUG_ALLOW_UNICODE`` is ``False``.

- ``OSCAR_SLUG_FUNCTION`` previously accepted a function as its value. It now
  only accepts a dotted path to a function as its value. Such functions must
  also now take a ``allow_unicode`` kwarg.
