Oscar 0.6.1 release notes
=========================

This is Oscar 0.6.1, a bug-fix release for Oscar 0.6.  

The following bugs were fixed:

* `#1128`_ - Calls to ``Source.debit`` without an ``amount`` argument were
  failing as ``balance`` was being called as a method instead of a property.
* `#1130`_ - Variant products were not fetching the product class instance
  correctly within ``is_shipping_required``.

.. _`#1130`: https://github.com/tangentlabs/django-oscar/issues/1130
