Dashboard
=========

The dashboard is the backend interface for managing the store. That includes the
product catalogue, orders and stock, offers etc.
The app itself only contains a view that serves as a kind of homepage, and
some logic for managing the navigation (in ``nav.py``). There's several sub-apps
that are responsible for managing different parts of the Oscar store.
