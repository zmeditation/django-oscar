django-oscar - Domain-driven e-commerce for Django
==================================================

django-oscar (henceforth, Oscar) is an e-commerce framework for Django designed
for building domain-driven applications.  It is structured in way that lets any
part of the core functionality be customised to suit the needs of your project.
In this way, the core structure of your application can match the domain at

Oscar is developed by `Tangent Labs`_, a London-based digital agency.  It is used in
production in several applications to sell everything from beer mats to ipads
