Welcome to django-oscar's documentation!
========================================

django-oscar is a flexible e-commerce platform, designed to build domain-driven
ecommerce sites, that can handle any requirement.  

It is developed by Tangent Labs, a London-based digital agency and is based on
their existing Taoshop PHP platform which powers several large-scale ecommerce sites.  

It is still in early development, but a stable release is planned for April 2011.
