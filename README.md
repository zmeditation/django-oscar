# Django-Oscar - Flexible e-commerce on Django

django-oscar is a flexible ecommerce platform, designed to build domain-driven
ecommerce sites to be constructed.  It is not supposed to be a framework that can
be downloaded and fully set up by simply adjusting a configuration file: there
will always be some developer work required to make sure the models match those
from your domain - this is the nature of domain modelling.

However, a small amount of work up front in determine the right models for your
shop can really pay off in terms of building a high-quality application that
is a pleasure to work with and maintain.
