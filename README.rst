Django-Oscar - Flexible e-commerce on Django 1.3
================================================

django-oscar is an e-commerce framework for Django 1.3 designed for building domain-driven
e-commerce sites.  It is structured in way that lets any part of the core
functionality be customised to suit the needs of your project.

It is currently in vigorous early development, but should stabilise over the
summer of 2011.
