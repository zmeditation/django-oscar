Django-Oscar - Flexible e-commerce on Django 1.3
================================================

django-oscar is a ecommerce framework for Django 1.3 for building domain-driven
ecommerce sites.  It is structured in way that lets any part of the core
ecommerce functionality be customised to suit the needs of your project.    

It is currently in vigorous early development, but should stabilise over the
summer of 2011.
