Django-Oscar - Flexible e-commerce on Django
============================================

*django-oscar* is an e-commerce framework for Django 1.3 designed for building
domain-driven e-commerce sites.  It is structured such that any part of the
core functionality can be customised to suit the needs of your project.  This
allows it to handle a wide range of e-commerce sites, from large-scale B2C
sites to complex B2B sites rich in domain-specific business logic.
