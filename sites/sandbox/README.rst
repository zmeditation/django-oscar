============
Sandbox site
============

This site is deployed to two locations:

http://sandbox.oscar.tangentlabs.co.uk/
---------------------------------------

This site is used for testing the vanilla Oscar functionality, that is, Oscar
without any customisation.  It is not a demo site for clients or potential Oscar
users.  It is built automatically from the HEAD of the master branch every 20
minutes.

http://qa.oscar.tangentlabs.co.uk/
----------------------------------

This site is for Tangent's QA team to test release candidates.  Like the sandbox
site, it is not customised but is built from fixed tags rather than continually
updated.
